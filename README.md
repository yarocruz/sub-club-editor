# # SUB CLUB EDITOR

[Sub Club](https://melted-april-eb6.notion.site/Sub-club-FAQ-7c659f29671244f88bcc8dce5139225e) is a service that brings creator payments to the Fediverse. It lets publishers and creators offer paid subscriptions to Mastodon and ActivityPub platforms.

While I found it easy to get started in creating a Sub Club account by following their [onboarding site](https://sub.club/onboarding), I find private '@t mentioning' to your sub.club handle a bit hacky.

This small (for now) website is a way to instead use [their REST API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/25748250/2sAXjJ6Yfe#intro) with simple UI to quickly post to your Premium sub.club.
